# Introduction

In this unit, you will create an app to make your own music by composing and synthesizing musical sounds generated by various instruments.

![screenshot of the music maker app](../images/musicMaker/music-maker-screenshot.png){:.enlargeImage}

This tutorial will give you some general hints to help you make the app, but you will be challenged with designing and making the app yourself.

# Music Maker

## Introduction

In this app, you can build upon the skills you learned in <strong>My Piano</strong> to build your own music maker. You can lay down some beats, overlay instruments, and be creative musically!

Look at the Media panel, which is below the Components panel, to see that several images and sounds have been included in the template project.

![screenshot of media assets in music maker app](../images/musicMaker/music-media.png){:.enlargeImage}

These assets have been included so you can focus more on designing and coding your music maker app.

Also, a sample of a few different layouts have been started in the Viewer.

![screenshot sample music maker app"](../images/musicMaker/music-maker-ui.png){:.enlargeImage}

These are included so you can get some ideas for how you might arrange the buttons to play and stop your music.


## Change the User Interface

The first step is to set your app’s orientation. Did you design your app to be used in a vertical position, or horizontal? Click on <strong>Screen1</strong> in the <strong>Components</strong> pane, and then change its <i>ScreenOrientation</i> property to either <span style="properties">Portrait</span> (vertical) or <span style="properties">Landscape</span> (horizontal). 

![screen orientation](../images/musicMaker/set-screen-orientation.png){:.enlargeImage}

Look at the template layout to see how the <span class="icon" alt="horizontal"></span> HorizontalArrangement and <span class="icon" alt="vertical"></span> VerticalArrangement components can change the layout.

![horizontal and vertical layouts"](../images/musicMaker/arrangement-examples.png){:.enlargeImage}

You can decide which type of layout you want for your app. You can arrange buttons horizontally, vertically, or a combination of both.

## How Layout Arrangements Work

<span class="icon" alt="button"></span> Buttons added to a <span class="icon" alt="horizontal"></span> HorizontalArrangement appear next to each other. Note that this <span class="icon" alt="horizontal"></span> HorizontalArrangement's <i>Height</i> is set to <span class="properties">50%</span> of the Screen, and its <i>AlignVertical</i> property is set to <span class="properties">Center</span>. That is why the <span class="icon" alt="button"></span> Buttons appear horizontally in the middle of the arrangement.

![3 buttons in a horizontalarrangement"](../images/musicMaker/horizontal.png){:.enlargeImage}

<span class="icon" alt="button"></span> Buttons added to a <span class="icon" alt="vertical"></span> VerticalArrangement appear below each other. This <span class="icon" alt="vertical"></span> VerticalArrangement's <i>Height</i> is set to <span class="properties">15%</span> of the Screen. Its <i>AlignHorizontal</i> property is set to <span class="properties">Left</span>. That is why the <span class="icon" alt="button"></span> Buttons appear below each other on the left side of the arrangement.

![3 buttons in a verticalarrangement"](../images/musicMaker/vertical.png){:.enlargeImage}

<strong>This is just a starting point. Pick the arrangement that you like best, and delete the other arrangements. Or delete them all, and start over! The design of your app is up to you.</strong>

## Add or Change Buttons

You've also been provided a few sample <span class="icon" alt="button"></span> Buttons. Again, feel free to use them, edit them, or delete them and add your own!

![sample buttons](../images/musicMaker/sample-buttons.png){:.enlargeImage}

You've got some square buttons with images on them representing a musical instrument. You've also got some Stop buttons in different colors and shapes. These are just samples. You can use them, edit, or delete them. It's up to you!

You can change the <i>Width</i> and <i>Height</i> properties of both your <span class="icon" alt="horizontal"></span> HorizontalArrangements and <span class="icon" alt="vertical"></span> VerticalArrangements as well as your <span class="icon" alt="button"></span> Buttons so that everything appears fully on the screen.

![setting width and height properties](../images/musicMaker/width-height-properties.png){:.enlargeImage}

Note that <span class="properties">Fill Parent</span> means to fill the component in which the current component is contained. For a <span class="icon" alt="button"></span> Button, its parent would be the <strong>Arrangement</strong> in which it is contained. For a <span class="icon" alt="horizontal"></span> HorizontalArrangement or <span class="icon" alt="vertical"></span> VerticalArrangement, its parent most likely will be <strong>Screen1</strong>.

The <i>Width</i> and <i>Height</i> can be set to an exact pixel value, or to a percentage. Using a percentage is recommended to ensure your components resize according to the size of the mobile device used.

Add more <span class="icon" alt="button"></span> Buttons so you have at least 4 instruments. Below are two examples of possible layouts.
![sample 1 of musicmaker app](../images/musicMaker/musicmaker-sample1.png){:.enlargeImage}
![sample 2 of musicmaker app](../images/musicMaker/musicmaker-sample2.png){:.enlargeImage}

You will have many <span class="icon" alt="button"></span> Buttons in this app, so make sure to rename them using descriptive names to make the coding of your app more manageable.

## Change Button Properties

Change the <span class="icon" alt="button"></span> Buttons' properties to fit your style. Match the instrument image, or change the color or shape.

For example, perhaps start with a drum. Select <strong>Button1</strong> in the template, change its <i>Image</i> to <span class="properties">“drum1.png”</span> and rename it to <strong>“Drum1Button”</strong>. 
![change drum button properties](../images/musicMaker/drum-button-properties.png){:.enlargeImage}

To make a Stop button for the drum, select <strong>Button2</strong> in the template, change its <i>BackgroundColor</i> to <span class="properties">“Red”</span>, <i>Text</i> to <span class="properties">“STOP”</span>, <i>Shape</i> to <span class="properties">“oval”</span> and rename it <strong>“StopDrum1Button”</strong>. 
![change stop drum button properties](../images/musicMaker/stop-drum-button-properties.png){:.enlargeImage}


## Add Player Components

You need to add a separate <span class="icon" alt="player"></span> Player component for each instrument in your app. In the example below, two <span class="icon" alt="player"></span> Player components are added and renamed appropriately.

![rename player components](../images/musicMaker/player-rename.gif){:.enlargeImage}

Then set the <i>Loop</i> property for each <span class="icon" alt="player"></span> Player to checked so the music loops continuously. And set the <i>Source</i> property to matching instrument sound files from the Media assets.

![set player properties](../images/musicMaker/player-properties.gif){:.enlargeImage}

## Code the Blocks

Click the Blocks button and go to the Blocks Editor.

![switch to blocks editor](../images/musicMaker/blocks-editor.png){:.enlargeImage}


Code the your first <span class="icon" alt="button"></span> Button. Using the drums example, there could be a button named **Drum1Button**. Drag out a <span class="control">Button.Click</span> event block for your drum button. For the matching <span class="icon" alt="player"></span> Player component, drag out a <span class="procedures">Player.Start</span> block, and snap it into the <span class="control">Button.Click</span> event block.

![](../images/musicMaker/drum-button-click.gif){:.enlargeImage}

The <span class="icon" alt="button"></span> Button to stop the instrument sound uses the same idea. Drag out a <span class="control">Button.Click</span> event block for the matching Stop Button for this instrument. Again, we’ll use the Drums as an example.

Drag out a matching <span class="procedures">Player.Stop</span> block and snap it into the <span class="control">StopButton.Click</span> event. This will make the <span class="icon" alt="player"></span> Player stop playing.

## Testing!

Now test starting and stopping that instrument with your two Buttons!

## Now do the rest

Now that you have one <span class="icon" alt="button"></span> Button set working, add code for your other instruments. Make sure you have a <span class="icon" alt="button"></span> Button to start the instrument, and one to stop it. Also, make sure you add a new <span class="icon" alt="player"></span> Player component for each instrument. Remember to name them appropriately!

# Expand your app

**Record and play back your music**
<br />Use the <span class="icon" alt="soundRecorder"></span> SoundRecorder component to record music, and then add another <span class="icon" alt="player"></span> Player component to play the resulting sound.

**Add a Pause button for each instrument.**


**Instead of 2 Buttons, make one Button toggle play/stop.**
<br />For each instrument in your app, make one Button, and then have it toggle to either act as a "Start" button, or a "Stop" button, depending on whether or not the instrument is playing.

**Add more instruments**
<br />You've been given several instruments and images to get started, but you can either download or create your own instrument sounds to add to your music making app. Have fun!
